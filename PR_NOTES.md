## PR Notes
- UI: Moved the `Export csv` button from Foods Table to the Eaten Table header (beside `Foods Table`) and kept the confirmation dialog there.
- Help content updated to describe the new location under Eaten Table.
- Screenshots to capture for the PR:
  1) Eaten Table top row showing `Foods Table` + `Export csv` side by side.
  2) Export CSV confirmation dialog on Eaten Table.
